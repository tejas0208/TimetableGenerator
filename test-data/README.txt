This folder contains some test-data to help developers
create a database.

The entry of data from the graphical interface takes
lot of time. The developers can save this time by 
running the 'runall.sh' script with a CSV data directory
as an argument.

Multiple CSV data directories are already given in the
'csv' folder.

Note: You need to change the username/password for mysql
in the runall.sh. By default it uses 'root' as login-id
and 'root' as password.
