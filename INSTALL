Installation of 'Samay' Timetabling Software
--------------------------------------------
A rough guide to installing 'Samay'. 
Lines begining with '>' indicate GNU/Linux commands.

* On Ubuntu based systems, first install the LAMP stack.
Refer to: http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-install-lamp-on-ubuntu

* Install the needed php packages
> sudo apt-get install php5-mysqlnd

* Copy the code of 'samay' into any folder
> cd 
> mkdir ~/src/
> cd src
> git clone git@gitlab.com:abhijit13/samay.git

* Give write permissions to 'samay' code folder.
Note: This is a security risk. This requirement will be changed later.
> chmod 777 ~/src/samay 

* Create a link from your DocumentRoot (typically /var/www/html)
to the samay code
> sudo ln -s ~/src/samay /var/www/html/

* Access the 'Samay' code.  Type in your browser
http://127.0.0.1/samay/

Follow the onscreen installation instructions.
Note: the installation is not very robust and often breaks!


Installation of Test-data
------------------------
After the installation is done, developers can install the test data
to run and test the software. 

Read the README.txt in test-data folder.
