3. If using XAMPP, copy taasika folder in C:\xampp\htdocs\

4. Go to your browser and type http:\\localhost\taasika

5. install.php loads.
Enter DB configuration details.

6. If you're going to use test-data, close the tab and open new tab. Run insert_data.php located in test-data folder:
http:\\localhost\taasika\test-data\insert_data.php
Or you can even just import timetable.sql located in root folder

6. If you're not going to use test-data, on the install.php page itself:
Create department.

Enter timetable configuration details.

7. Curl is used in automate.php to call saveNewSnapshot function in snapshot.php
