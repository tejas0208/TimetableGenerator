Samay is a timetabling software for schools, colleges, universities.

Samay was developed by Abhijit A.M. and Vinay Desai as a hobby project
to help the Department of Computer Engineering and IT, at College of 
Engineering, Pune to develop it's own timetable.

It was developed as a semi-automated software. It disallows any overlapping
entries to be created and simplifies the task of manual creation of a
timetable.
